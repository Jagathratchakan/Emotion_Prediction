# Emotion_Prediction
Dataset: Make sure you have a dataset of labeled audio recordings where emotions are explicitly expressed or annotated. Update the audio_path variable to the path of your audio files, and update the labels list to include the appropriate emotion labels.

Feature Extraction: The code uses the librosa.feature.mfcc() function to extract MFCC features from the audio files. If you want to extract additional features, refer to the librosa library's available functions. You may also consider normalizing or scaling the features if needed.

Model Selection: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used for emotion prediction in the provided code. If you want to explore other models, you can replace the SVC() classifier with a different model from scikit-learn or any other machine learning library of your choice.

Training: The code splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split() from scikit-learn. You can adjust the test_size parameter to control the proportion of data used for testing. The model is trained using svm.fit() by providing the training features X_train and labels y_train.

Model Evaluation: The code calculates the accuracy of the trained model on the testing set using svm.score(). You can evaluate the model's performance by examining other evaluation metrics or by visualizing the results (e.g., confusion matrix).

Testing: To predict emotions for a new audio sample, update the file path in the librosa.load() function with the path to your new audio file. The code then extracts features from the new audio sample using librosa.feature.mfcc() and reshapes the features to match the model's input shape. Finally, the model predicts the emotion label using svm.predict().

Deployment: If you want to deploy the model into an application or system, you can modify the code accordingly. This might involve creating an API endpoint or integrating the model into an existing framework. Ensure you have a labeled audio recordings dataset where emotions are explicitly expressed or annotated. Update the audio_path variable to the path of your audio files, and update the labels list to include the appropriate emotion labels.

Preprocessing: If you need to apply any preprocessing steps to the audio data, you can add them before feature extraction. This might include steps like resampling the audio or removing background noise. You can refer to the librosa documentation for specific preprocessing functions.
